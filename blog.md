When you step into the Microsoft Theater, you’ll find yourself surrounded not just by other creators, but by potential future collaborators, mentees, mentors or even friends. The Creative Super Sessions will invite hundreds of like-minded and like-interested MAX attendees, all coming together to learn about everything from brand identities to design to Adobe products to creativity itself.

An impressive lineup of our most popular speakers like Paula Scher, Aaron Draplin and M. Night Shyamalan will share industry secrets and tricks of their trades. Can’t wait to attend? Here’s what you can see if you register for the Creative Super Sessions:

Creative skills top the list as critical for today’s workforce. But are students getting enough of these skills in school and working them into their resumes and job interviews? M. Night Shyamalan is teaming up with Adobe executives for this session all about teaching creativity as a fundamental skill.

Renowned film director M. Night Shyamalan, who has written a book on education reform, will discuss how education at every level must quickly adapt to teach creative skills in the classroom and beyond –  in spite of the current curriculum. As one of our generation’s most creative humans, his education insights promise to be no less thrilling than his films’ notoriously twisty endings.
